grid               - creates model grid (regional.depths, regional.grid, 
                     latlon.dat, depthsXXXXXX.uf and newpos.uf) - gebco is subaveraged to two
                     minutes resolution (for computer memory reasons).
                     See also README in Code dir

You need the following data files:
grid.info          - specifies conformal mapping
grid.bathy         - specifies bathymetry to use
grid.topofix       - specifies grid topography corrections to be done - 
                     this file is actually optional, but stronly recommended ;-)

Example data files (grid.*) can be found  in this directory. 

There is also some data file info for the different topo datasets in these directories:
BODC  
ETOPO5
GEBCO 
IBCAO
Met.no  (CONMAN grid option)



A note on grid.topofix:
-----------------------
The format for grid.topofix
is that each line contains 5 numbers: first and last i-point, then first and last
j-point. Finally the depth value is given. the depth within the block:
(first i:last i,first j:last j) wil be set to this depth. Ex: This sets the block
i=1:20, j=1:20 to zero depths:
1 20 1 20 0.

Commented lines are ignored in grid.topofix, this line would be ignored:
#2 2 1 100 0.
