This directory contains routines for processing and postprocessing model output.
The shell scripts (.sh) mainly utilize programs in the HYCOM_ALL and MSCPROGS,
and some ofd the python routines in this directory. Meny of the shell scripts
require you to run them from an experiment directory, because it needs to source
the REGION.src and EXPT.src files, copy files to the correct location etc etc.

Most of the python scripts can be called from the command line, but some need
the hycom setup files (grid and bathymetry) to be present.
